# Welcome to the Studio Week 2!
Last week we learned how to set up web pages and embed some pre-existing maps. This week we start building our own maps. And we'll start with a series of exercises for creating basemaps. 

## Expected Outputs for this week / what to submit: 
This repo contains starter code for a small, 4 page website that contains a series of different base maps, each on it's own page. You can preview the starter site by opening the index.html file in a web browser. The first three pages you will modifying using the following files and instructions. 
- Start with `index.html`. The instructions for completing this map are under [exercise1](https://github.com/IDCE-MSGIS/studio-week2/blob/master/instructions/exercise1.md)
- Next up is `Mapbox-gl-js-cwm.html`. The instructions for completing this map are under [exercise2](https://github.com/IDCE-MSGIS/studio-week2/blob/master/instructions/exercise2.md)
- Then there is `Mapbox-gl-js-ct.html`. Follow instructions in the  `Mapbox-gl-js-ct.html` file to add a marker and popup to a Mapbox GL JS map.
- Finally, you'll create a brand new Mapbox style and insert it into `Mapbox-gl-js-bm.html`.  The instructions for completing this map are under [exercise4](https://github.com/IDCE-MSGIS/studio-week2/blob/master/instructions/exercise4.md)

**At the end of the week you will submit a link to your repo via Moodle.** Happy coding!
