# Welcome to the Studio Week 2!
Last week we learned how to set up web pages and embed some pre-existing maps. This week we start building our own maps. And we'll start with a series of exercises for creating basemaps. 

## Expected Outputs for this week / what to submit: 
This repo contains starter code for a small, 4 page website that contains a series of different base maps, each on it's own page. *:warning: Would be good to explain to them how to preview the starter site - e.g. https://verma-priyanka.github.io/pages/index.html.* The first three pages you will modifying useing the following files and instructions. 
- Start with `Leaflet-cwm.html`. The instructions for completing this map are at: __:warning:__
- Next up is `Mapbox-gl-js-cwm.html`. The instructions for completing this map are at: __:warning:__
- Then there is `Mapbox-gl-js-ct.html`. The instructions for completing this map are at: __:warning:__

Finally, you'll create a brand new Mapbox style and insert it into :warning:`NEED-FILENAME-HERE`. To do this, [follow the Mapbox tutorial for creating a custom style](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/create-a-custom-style/?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=sem%7Cgoogle%7Cbrand%7Cchko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&utm_term=brand&utm_content=chko-googlesearch-pr01-dynamicsearchcampaign-nb.broad-all-landingpage-search&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-bjyBRCcARIsAFboWg0c06wf34jAP1XV8i53wUBsfaO3P-sB5wC7sPMMxcgBtUjstEN5330aAuPhEALw_wcB), which will walk you through creating a map using Mapbox corporate colors. Once you've done this, your next step will be to create another style to match the coorproate colors of your favorite international development, environmental, humanitarian, or non-profit organizations. For example, if I wanted to make a map for the U.S. Agency for International Development, I'd do some online research to see if I could find any "branding" or "design guidelines" ([like this](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1869/USAID_GSM-02_04_2020.pdf)), which might give me specific information on the colors they use. If I *couldn't* find any branding guidelines for my favorite organiztion, I might try [entering the organization's URL into a website that would crawl the code to pick out specific colors](https://www.colorcombos.com/grabcolors.html) or use a [web browser extension to select colors on screen and find out what they are](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka?hl=en). You could also use the [developer tools built into Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) that we looked at in class to inspect elements of a web page including the HTML and .css files. In any case, make your webmap sing with the colors of your favorite organization!

Once you've created a custom basemap using Mapbox, you'll need to add it to your webpage. [Instructions for this can be found here (starting with step #2)](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog371/tree/master/lectures/lec13). *:warning: We probably need to walk through this to make sure these steps all work, or copy/paste them here*.

**At the end of the week you will submit a link to your repo via Moodle.** Happy coding!

## Additional Resources. 
After successfully following the instructions above you can take things farther... *:warning:Any thoughts for stretch goals that they can wrestle with? Additional things to add to their maps, for example?*?
